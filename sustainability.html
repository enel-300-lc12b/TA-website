        <h1 class="sustainability__title">We have a plan.</h1>
        <p>We know sustainability is important to you, and it's important to us too. Earth only has so many resources to
            go around after all. That's why we've designed the TA with sustainability in mind.</p>

        <div class="sustainability-entry">
            <h2>Modularity</h2>
            <p>The TA is modular in the sense that it has multiple additional components that will add on top of the
                temperature sensor. Users are free to pick the additional components along with the standalone product.
                For example, a soil moisture detector can be purchased separately from the thermometer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This allows you to only acquire the parts of the product that you need, and replacing parts when they
                wear out is no problem. This reduces the waste produced from our device. Modularity also works well with
                design for disassembly, which is another sustainability consideration we took into account; with a
                modular unit, the case can come off to be recycled.</p>

        <div class="sustainability-entry">
            <h2>Design for Disassembly</h2>
            <p>Having a modular product also means that it can be disassembled when the time comes. Components for the
                TA can easily be disassembled when repairs are needed. The casing can come off when it needs to be
                recycled, and the moisture sensor can be removed when it is not in use or damaged.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Displosal for disassembly allows for longevity of the product because each component can be replaced
                separately. This makes it easy to recycle part of the product at the end of its life by separating the
                recyclable casing from the rest of the device, reducing waste and allowing you to dispose of the prodict
                in an environmentally friendly way.</p>

        <div class="sustainability-entry">
            <h2>Environmentally Friendly Materials</h2>
            <p>We use sustainable materials for the casing of the product. The plastic used for the casing is
                recyclable and comes from renewable resources. We support ethical sourcing of our products and aim for a
                carbon neutral approach to production.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We're committed to minimizing our carbon footprint. Using materials that are recyclable or biodegradable
                is one step towards this. Providing a high quality and modular product will prevent waste from going
                into landfills, and when the product does reach the end of its life, parts of it are recycled to extend
                the life of the materials used.</p>

        <div class="sustainability-entry">
            <h2>Production on Demand</h2>
            <p>Our product is made only after your order has been placed. Production on demand helps to reduce the
                amount of waste produced. Since units are only made when users order them, there will not be leftovers
                that go unsold.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="sustainability-entry">
            <h2>Repair</h2>
            <p>A repair manual will be provided with the purchase of the product. The repair manual will list all the
                components and give clear instructions on how to repair and replace them. Users will be able to purchase
                components that are broken to replace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This reduces waste because you only buy the parts you need, rather than a whole new product.
                Since the product is modular, if a specific component breaks, users can simply replace it using the
                repair manual.</p>

            <h2>E-Shop</h2>
            <p>The very website you're browsing right now provices the platform for us to implement our production on
                demand and modular models. Customers are free to shop for what they need online from the comfort of
                their own home. Our website is also used to help promote transparency regarding our products and
                manufacturing.</p>
