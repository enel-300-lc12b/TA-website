            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Our Pursuit</h2>
            <p>We're a group of second year electrical engineering students with a goal. Our mission is to help plant
                owners
                take the best care of their plants with as little hassle as possible. We've been victims of
                forgetfulness
                far too many times; countless numbers of our plants have ended up suffering due to our neglect for them,
                and
                we're sure many other plants undergo the same thing.</p>
            <h2>Innovative Plant Care</h2>
            <p>The TA (Temperature Alarm) is our solution to this problem. It is a plant monitoring device that can
                monitor
                the temperature and soil moisture content, alerting the user if either of these parameters are
                undesirable
                for the plant. The wireless speaker allows for instant notification even from a distance away. The user
                can
                set a range of temperatures to stay within for cusomization, and the modular temperature and soil
                sensors
                makes repair easy. With the TA, having healthy plants is as easy as ever.</p>
